# Hollow Knight: Silksong Save Decoder

> A lightweight Streamlit web app to decrypt and visualize your **Hollow Knight: Silksong** save files (`user1.dat`) into human-readable JSON format.

---

##  Overview

This tool lets you **upload your Silksong `.dat` save file**, decrypt it using the known AES key and header pattern, and **view or export** it as a structured `.json` file.

Perfect for:
- Backup & inspection of save progress  
- Debugging or research on Silksong‚Äôs save structure  
- Data visualization for fan tools or mod development

Would you like me to include a section for the **reverse script (JSON ‚Üí DAT re-encryptor)** too, so it‚Äôs ready when that part works cleanly?
